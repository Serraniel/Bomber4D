**Work in progress. Please check develop branch as far as there is no release version!**

Bomber4D is a simple bomberman game made with Delphi and is intented for learning approaches. This project basically is a prototype for new trainees to see a simple project made in Delphi and to learn from its code.

## IDE-Setup
Sweet Filemanager is developed with [Delphi Community Editon (free)](https://www.embarcadero.com/de/products/delphi/starter) 10.2.3 Tokyo. If you got a newer version you usually have access to the older releases, too. Check out [EmbarcaderoÂ´s webpage](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/previous-versions) for more information regarding the IDE. 
If you plan to contribute to the project you may also check the following points:
* Format configurations ~~are stored~~ will be stored under `.\ide_configs\Formatter_Serraniel.config` soon(tm). You can either load them manually into your IDE or copy them into your `%appdata%\Embarcadero\BDS\19.0\` folder and select them in the Delphi options. 
* This project uses [Project Magician](https://www.uweraabe.de/Blog/2018/05/17/keep-your-project-files-clean-with-project-magician/) by [Uwe Raabe](https://www.uweraabe.de/) to normalize the projects file.  You may install the plugin to the IDE to ensure you have normalized project files.
* This project uses [madExcept collection](http://madshi.net/madExceptDescription.htm). You may install *madBasic*, *madExcept 4* (a non-commercial free license *is* fine for this project, as there will not be any commercial version of it), *madKernel*, *madSecurity* and *madShell*.
